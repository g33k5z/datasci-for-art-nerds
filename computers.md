### A brief history of computers
The evolution of computers is a fascinating journey that mirrors the rapid advances in technology and society. This timeline highlights some of the most notable events and contributions that have shaped the computer as we know it today.

- **Pre-1940s**:
  - **1801**: Joseph Marie Jacquard invents the Jacquard loom, the first machine to use punched cards to control a sequence of operations. This innovation is considered an important precursor to computer programming.
  - **1837**: Charles Babbage designs the Analytical Engine, an early concept of a general-purpose computer. Although it was never completed, Babbage's design included many elements present in modern computers, such as a control unit and memory.
  - **1843**: Ada Lovelace, often considered the first computer programmer, writes the first algorithm intended to be executed by a machine, specifically for Babbage's Analytical Engine.
  - **1890**: Herman Hollerith develops a punch card system to tabulate the 1890 US Census, founding the Tabulating Machine Company, which eventually becomes IBM. This represents a significant advancement in data processing technology.
- **1940s**: The development of the first electronic computers, such as the ENIAC, which were used primarily for military calculations during World War II.
- **1950s**: The invention of the transistor at Bell Labs, which significantly reduced the size and cost of computers, leading to more widespread commercial and scientific use.
- **1960s**: The birth of UNIX at Bell Labs. Developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others, UNIX was a groundbreaking operating system notable for its simplicity, portability, and multitasking capabilities. It laid the foundation for many modern operating systems.
- **1970s**: 
  - The introduction of personal computers, such as the Apple II and the Commodore PET, which made computing accessible to individuals and small businesses.
  - The creation of the GNU Project by Richard Stallman, aiming to develop a free UNIX-like operating system. This initiative sparked the development of the Free Software Movement and laid the groundwork for the later development of the Linux kernel.
- **1980s**: 
  - The proliferation of the graphical user interface (GUI), popularized by XEROX PARC's development and later adopted by Apple and Microsoft, revolutionizing the way users interact with computers.
  - The release of the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds in 1991, combined with GNU tools, forming the GNU/Linux operating system. This open-source project offered a free and flexible alternative to proprietary operating systems, greatly influencing software development and deployment practices.
- **1990s to Present**: 
  - The explosion of the internet and the development of the World Wide Web, transforming computers from standalone tools to interconnected devices capable of accessing a vast amount of information and services online.
  - The continued evolution of UNIX and Linux, with the latter becoming a cornerstone of modern computing, powering everything from servers and supercomputers to mobile devices and home appliances.

### Binary
Binary is the fundamental language of computers, based on a two-symbol system or base-2 numeral system. Each digit in this system is referred to as a bit, which is the smallest unit of data in computing, representing a state of 0 or 1. Computers use binary to process and store all kinds of data, from numbers and letters to images and sound. This simplicity allows for the design of electronic devices that can reliably interpret and manipulate binary data, forming the basis of digital computing.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing represents the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. It is categorized into several types, each serving different needs and use cases:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides fundamental compute, network, and storage resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development. PaaS enables developers to build, test, deploy, and manage applications without the complexity of maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Services.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. Examples include Google Workspace, Salesforce, and Microsoft Office 365.
- **Serverless**: Goes beyond PaaS, abstracting the server even further. It allows developers to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. Serverless computing automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Examples include Google CloudFunc, AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.
