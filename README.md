## About
Work in progress, opinionated, overfit
- STATUS: hella sus
- My plan is to poc outline, let an llm blow out initial/basic content, fact check, reduce and refine, sprinkle in resource links
- Scoring function
  - General concepts from unknown unknowns to known unknowns
  - Time to get started on free recouces (SQL: Bigquery public datasets, Python: Colabs, AI Study Buddy: ChatGPT, ...)
